      title: The Thing that Makes the Thing<br>is Always More Interesting than the Thing
      text: Titled after a lecture by Casey Reas The Thing that Makes the Thing is Always more Interesting than the Thing is a hand-bound book of images that have been re-constructed with a Processing program. They were all taken from NASA's public domain images (macro-imaging of our lives) or personal instant photographs (micro-imaging). The program obscures the images re-drawing it with reference to the original but with more randomness and more machine-provided understanding of things like edges and focus-points. Human-provided focus points are then honed in with a second-pass of drawing.<br>Each photo re-drawing has a vellum overlay of the original NASA caption which is backwards until the image is revealed and the caption sits on the opposite page.
