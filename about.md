I'm a Visual Arts student at Emily Carr University of Art + Design in Vancouver, BC. I came here for animation but ended up exploring everything I could get my hands on, from 3D modeling to typography to programming to print-making (and incidentally no animating).
            
I used to worry about specializing, but nowadays I write about a lot of things and make a lot of things. Most of what you'll find in my writing is reflected in my work, including programming, generative art, print-making, web development, ADHD, social sciences, and typography. Every once in a while I'll decide I'm going to become the queen of [insert any skill here] but it all tends to be centered around a system and how we can use/abuse it.

I drink a lot of coffee and chill with my ball python Udon. I also intern at [Porchlight Press](http://porchlightpress.com/), a letterpress studio in Kitsilano.
