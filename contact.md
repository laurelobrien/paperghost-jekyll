For general inquiries or collaborations, you can email me at [laureljobrien@gmail.com](mailto:laureljobrien@gmail.com).

You can also find me & my work on social media.

**[laurelobrien on github](http://github.com/laurelobrien)** — a mix of Python, Processing, and web development.

**[laurelobrien on instagram](http://instagram.com/laurelobrien)** — I'm probably the most active on instagram, and you can find works in progress and doodles that don't end up in a formal portfolio.

**[laureljan on twitter](http://twitter.com/laureljan)** — turns out there's at least one other person on this planet named Laurel O'Brien. I mostly use twitter for swearing at electronics and CSS in a public forum.

**[milkspoon on pinterest](http://pinterest.com/milkspoon)** — I keep boards updated of interesting typography, graphic design, web design & development, new media arts, and illustration. And some sick recipes for my own use but if you enjoy butter and garlic you'll have a great time.
